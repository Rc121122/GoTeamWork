### Goal: Public release v1.0.0
- Production UI/UX polish.
- Support drag to paste. Drag a shared content from main window to any other apps.
- Support drag to copy. Drag any file/image from file explorer to main window to share.

### Later Goals (to be done after v1.1.0)
Issue: critical UX problem: When the gopher HUD is called, the AlwaysOnTop property makes it overlay on top, after HUD disappears and change back to main window, it can go beneath other windows. There isn't other wails api to control window z-order.
Solution: Make the app as background app, hide most of time, trigger by system tray icon to open. After HUD disappears, shrink mainwindow to very tiny size(maybe 10x10px) and transparent, so it won't affect user experience. Only when user click system tray icon, restore main window to normal size and position.
