## ToDo:
1. Improve frontend UI/UX design.

## Done:
1. Organize directory: Moved documentation files (.md) to `docs/` folder.
2. Zip Stability: Refactored zip logic to `clip_helper/zip.go` for cross-platform support and added `TestZipLargeFile` (10MB) to verify stability. Fixed redeclaration errors.
